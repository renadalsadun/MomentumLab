# Momentum Lab Clone

Welcome to the **Momentum Lab** project.

This was a lab from the **Software Engineering Bootcamp** provided by **General Assembly**. Each participant worked individually to develop their own Momentum-like website, and here’s my version!


## Project Overview

This web page displays the following features:

- **Time**: Shows the current time.
- **City and Temperature**: Displays the city and temperature of the visitor's country.
- **Quote of the Day**: A random quote fetched from an API (Note: You’ll need the CORS extension enabled to see the quotes).
- **To-Do List**: You can add items to your to-do list (these will persist only in the current session).

### Features

- Background image and quote of the day are refreshed each time you reload the page.
- Add custom to-do list items that will display in the list.

### Current Limitations

- The to-do list will **disappear** upon page refresh.
- You cannot **delete** items from the to-do list yet.
- The need for CORS extension in order to see the quotes. 
  
### Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS** for the structure and styling.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and API calls.
- **Axios** to fetch data from APIs like weather and quotes.
- **Unsplash API** for random background images.
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for fetching weather data.
- **ZenQuotes API** for daily motivational quotes.
